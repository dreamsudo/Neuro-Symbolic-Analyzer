INCIDENT REPORT: IR-2024-ALPHA
DATE: 2023-11-15
SEVERITY: CRITICAL
STATUS: ACTIVE

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
SOC analysts have detected a sophisticated intrusion attempt targeting the HR subnet.

OBSERVATIONS (CURRENT FACTS):
1. Network logs detected a successful Phishing (T1566) campaign targeting employee emails.
2. EDR telemetry found active execution of PowerShell (T1059) scripts on host HR-WKSTN-04.
3. We have also seen indications that Masquerading (T1036) is active, as the malware is disguising itself as 'svchost.exe'.

ANALYSIS & PROJECTIONS (EPISTEMIC REASONING):
Based on the behavior, we suspect the attacker has already achieved Persistence via Scheduled Task (T1053). 

If the PowerShell execution continues unchecked, historical data suggests this leads to Impair Defenses (T1562) to disable our antivirus.

CRITICAL PATH PREDICTION:
If defenses are impaired, we believe this leads to Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486) (Ransomware deployment).
However, if they pivot to the network, this leads to Remote Services (T1021) for lateral movement.
